        <p>Both Batwoman and Batman are vigilantes in the fictional city of Gotham. The characters mostly exist in the comics to help each other. With Batwoman being initially created to set her partner's sexuality record straight, they take off to work together. Their existence in Gotham as Batman and Batwoman, albeit being illegal, is much need by the residents who suffer in the hands of the highly skilled criminals – such as the Joker – who have mastered their techniques. The police department is simply lacking in comparison to the skills of the criminals and they cannot help but watch as the residents get terrorized. Furthermore, neither Batwoman nor Batman work for the government, hence their crime-solving is not biased…show more content…
            Batwoman is comparable to a female version of Batman in the American comic book series, DC Comics. Her character is played secretly by Katherine Kane, who, just like Batman, masks her face during the nights to fight crime. Just as Batman, she is a successful entrepreneur who has devoted her wealth and skills to fighting crime. Again similarly, Batwoman does not possess any superpowers and relies on her military trainings to combat crime. In short, both vigilante characters wear the bat costume to fight crime in Gotham. Nonetheless, Batwoman is an entirely independent superhero with her own ways and rulebooks.
            
            Both Batman and Batwoman are victims of crime and the pain and loss suffered from the criminal acts is their mutual driving force. Batman, at a young age, lost both of his parents in a robbery shootout. When the crime happened, he did not know what to do – he simply watched as his parents' bodies lay lifeless by the road. The image was forever imprinted on the boy's mind. He could not, no matter how hard he tried, to stop recounting the night he became an orphan. After school and running a successful business, Wayne feels that he is ready to give back to the city by fighting criminals. </p>
